## in general

Focus on areas of code that are relevant to the task at hand. 
Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task at hand.
Write thorough tests for all major functionality.
Make sure all tests pass before submitting your code.
Make sure your code is well-documented.
Make sure your code does not result in any linting errors.
Make sure your code does not result in any build errors.
Always think about providing the simplest solution that can work, even if it means reduced functionality.
Always thinks about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by your changes.
Try too ensure that each file/module/function has a single responsibility.
Keep file sizes small and manageable, if a file is morre than 200 lines long, consider breaking it up into smaller files.

## Code notes

- two spaces for indentation
- prefer type definitions instead of interfaces
- prefer functional programming instead of classes
